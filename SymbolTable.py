"""The compiler's symbol table module. It is used to extend the syntax analyzer built
in project 10. This module sotres and handles the following data:
-> The identifier's name, as done by the current version of the syntax analyzer.
-> The identifier's category: var, argument, static, field, class, or subroutine.
-> If the identifier's category is var, argument, static, or field, the running index
    assigned to the identifier by the symbol table.
-> Whether the identifier is presently being defined (e.g. the identifier stands for a
    variable declared in a "var" statement) or used."""
